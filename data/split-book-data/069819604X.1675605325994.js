It seemed like the thing to do at the time. It should have only involved hunting down killer goblins, zombie goats, and an occasional troll. Instead, our home was viewed as neutral ground, a place where humans would feel safe to come and interact with the fae.</p> <p>The reality is that nothing and no one is safe.&nbsp;As generals and politicians face off with the Gray Lords of the fae, a storm is coming, and her name is Death.</p> <p>But we are pack, and we have given our word.&nbsp;</p> <p>We will die to keep it.</p>";
