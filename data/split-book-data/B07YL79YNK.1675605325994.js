With his trusty Combat Wombat at his side, and the world’s worst intern in his way, Tom vows to Insure and Protect.

Chaos and a perilous lack of glazeds ensues.</p> <p><b>\"Apocalypse Cow\"</b> <br> The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse walk into a Waffle House. Tom and Jimmy walk out. Civilizations across the multiverse threaten to collapse.
