window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>He's a billionaire heir. A grump supreme. Hater of people. Bigger hater of peopling with people. And my new fake boyfriend.</b></p> <p><i>\"Emotionally unavailable\"</i> doesn’t even begin to describe Hayes Rutherford. He’s cold. He’s distant. He has more defenses than a nuclear missile silo. And he’s the ultimate catch of the century. At least, according to his bank statement.</p> <p>My job’s simple: Keep Hayes’ matchmaking relatives, and all interested ladies, away from the cranky, grumpy walled-off heir to my favorite movie empire, by pretending to be his one true love; and in return, he won’t ruin my life over a teensy tiny little misunderstanding.</p> <p>But the more I sneak past his walls and fences, the more I realize that, while we might be from different worlds, we have more in common than either of us expected. The man under all the glitz, glamour, and dollar signs could be the real love of my life.</p> <p>But you know what they say about fake-dating a billionaire: It’s all fun and games, until the scandals start.</p> <p><i>The Last Eligible Billionaire</i> is a swoony, laugh-out-loud romance, featuring a botched wax job, a woman in over her head, a man in over his heart, and the sweetest misguided dog to ever play matchmaker...or at least make sure these two anti-love birds never have clothes when they get out of the shower. It stands alone, and comes complete with grand romantic gestures.</p>";
