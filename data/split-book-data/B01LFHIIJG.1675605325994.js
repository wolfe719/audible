window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Everyone's favorite rascal turns learning to read into a hilarious adventure through the power of imagination. </p> <p>Ever since Dory met Rosabelle, a real true friend whose imagination and high spirits match her own, school has been pretty good. But now the class is learning to read, and it's proving to be a challenge for Dory. While Rosabelle can read chapter books in her head, Dory is stuck with baby books about a happy little farm. Dory wishes for a potion to turn her into a reader, but things don't go as planned. </p> <p>Suddenly a naughty little girl who looks an awful lot like Dory's imaginary nemesis, Mrs. Gobble Gracker, shows up. And a black sheep leaves the pages of the farm book to follow Dory to school. It really needs her help - this seems like a job for a superhero! And it would help if she knew how to read. </p> <p>In her third book, Dory the rascal takes reluctant reading to new heights with a story that is as one of a kind and as hilarious as she is. </p>";
