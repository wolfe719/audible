window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I'm a witch without a coven working for a detective sergeant turned into a dog.</b></p> <p>After the coven excommunicates me, I need to find a new job. So when I see a sign asking for an assistant - only witches need apply - I feel my fortunes might be trending up. Sure, there's a murder to solve, a killer on my tail, and my new boss is a French Bulldog, but at least it's not working checkout in a supermarket.</p> <p>Beezley and I soon form a private investigation service to help with the weird and wonderful cases my small New Zealand town of Riverhead has to offer. Join us as we chase leads into danger and back out again, with the help of some black magic and an occasional chewy dog treat.</p> <p><b>This collection contains the following titles: </b></p> <p><b><i>Selective Spells </i></b></p> <p><b><i>Vexatious Voodoo </i></b></p> <p><b><i>Muddled Mutt </i></b></p>";
