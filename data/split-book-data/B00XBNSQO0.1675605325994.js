window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Sixteen-year-old Tasso Menzies just finished burying his grandfather next to his mother and grandmother on the family farm when he receives an order from his estranged uncle to come to Capital City. He doesn't want to leave the only home he's ever known. He doesn't want to be apprenticed on a space freighter crewed by Texas cowboys of Mexican descent. He certainly doesn't want to be gone for so long that his home and inheritance are stolen. While trying to fit in and still get home he learns what it is like to live in space, what a cheerleader is, how spicy a taco can be, and that Texicans like a good fight as much as he does. </p>";
