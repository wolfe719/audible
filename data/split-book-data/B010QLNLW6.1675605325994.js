window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The explosive conclusion to <i>Nexus</i> and <i>Crux</i>. </p> <p>Global unrest spreads through the US, China, and beyond. Secrets and lies set off shockwaves of anger, rippling from mind to mind. Riot police battle neutrally linked protestors. Armies are mobilized. Political orders fall. Nexus-driven revolution is in here. </p> <p>Against this backdrop a new breed of posthuman children are growing into their powers. And a once-dead scientist, driven mad by her torture, is closing in on her plans to seize planet's electronic systems and reforge everything in her image. A new <i>Apex</i> species is here. The world will never be the same. </p> <p>Ramez Naam is a professional technologist and was involved in the development of Microsoft Internet Explorer and Outlook.
