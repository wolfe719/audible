window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Soul-eating tattoo. Check</b></p> <p><b>Self-replicating knife. Check</b></p> <p><b>Two-hundred-year-old score to settle. Double check.</b></p> <p><b>Meet the immortal Doc Holliday.</b></p> <p>Lying on his deathbed, Dr. John Holliday was offered a choice: Let the tuberculosis finish its work or accept immortality. Doc chose the latter, knowing full well that such \"gifts\" don't come cheap, but damned if the last 200 years haven't been a blast. Partying, playing, fighting, killing; yes, eternal life's been good.... But the time to get serious has finally come, and the task he's always known he was saved for is at hand.</p> <p>Now in modern-day Denver, Doc will be pushed to his limits to keep his promise and save the missing descendent of the beautiful shaman who gave him everlasting life. The trouble is things aren't going as planned, and it's becoming clear that there is far more at stake than Doc bargained for....</p> <p><b>Fans of edgy urban fantasy look no further! If you're into badass, morally ambiguous antiheroes who don't flinch at killing bad guys (and stealing their souls), then this is the audiobook for you! It has the perfect blend of supernatural action, humor, and mystery that you crave!</b></p> <p><b><i>Listen to this first book in the ongoing series today! </i></b>(Do it now.... Don’t fight it.... Just let it happen).</p> <p><b>Happy listening!</b></p> <p><b>Titles List: </b></p> <p></p> <ol> <li><i>Hidden </i></li> <li><i>Coup D’état </i></li> <li><i>Ruthless </i></li> <li><i>Instinct </i></li> <li><i>Rogues </i></li> <li><i>Empire </i></li> <li><i>Omens </i></li> <li><i>Chasm </i></li> </ol> <p><b>And more...</b></p> <p>Note: This version of Doc is a knife guy rather than a gun guy. Fun historical fact: The real life Doc's first confirmed kill was done with a knife; he only switched to guns because of his failing health. Enjoy!</p> <p>facebook/LoneGhostPublishing&nbsp;</p>";
