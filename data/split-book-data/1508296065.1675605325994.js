Prepare to BE slain.” (Nic Stone,</b> <b><i>New York Times</i></b> <b>best-selling author of</b> <b><i>Dear Martin</i></b> <b>and</b> <b><i>Odd One Out</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b><i>Ready Player One</i></b> <b>meets</b> <b><i>The Hate U Give</i></b> <b>in this dynamite debut novel that follows a fierce teen game developer as she battles a real-life troll intent on ruining the</b> <b><i>Black Panther</i></b><b>-inspired video game she created and the safe community it represents for black gamers.</b></p> <p>By day, 17-year-old Kiera Johnson is an honors student, a math tutor, and one of the only black kids at Jefferson Academy. But at home, she joins hundreds of thousands of black gamers who duel worldwide as Nubian personas in the secret multiplayer online role-playing card game <i>Slay</i>. No one knows Kiera is the game developer, not her friends, her family, not even her boyfriend, Malcolm, who believes video games are partially responsible for the “downfall of the black man”.</p> <p>But when a teen in Kansas City is murdered over a dispute in the <i>Slay </i>world, news of the game reaches mainstream media, and <i>Slay </i>is labeled a racist, exclusionist, violent hub for thugs and criminals. Even worse, an anonymous troll infiltrates the game, threatening to sue Kiera for “anti-white discrimination”.</p> <p>Driven to save the only world in which she can be herself, Kiera must preserve her secret identity and harness what it means to be unapologetically black in a world intimidated by blackness. But can she protect her game without losing herself in the process?&nbsp;</p>";
