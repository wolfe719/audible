window.bookSummaryJSON = "Henry and his slobbering dog Mudge are visiting Great-Grandpa Bill, who lives in a house with lots of other grandpas. Henry likes the grandpas because they play checkers and rock in rocking chairs. Mudge likes them because they feed him mint candies. When Henry and Mudge leave the house to go exploring, they find a beautiful swimming pond. They come back to let everybody know, and soon all the grandpas want to go swimming. Henry's father says, \"We'll have to go in our Skivvies.\" Before long they are all enjoying a nice day of swimming in their underwear! <i>Henry and Mudge and the Great Grandpas</i> won the first-ever Theodor Seuss Geisel Award for a distinguished beginning reader book. Newbery Medalist Cynthia Rylant has charmed countless children - and their parents - with this gently humorous series, and Recorded Books offers a large selection of <i>Henry and Mudge's</i> tales.";
