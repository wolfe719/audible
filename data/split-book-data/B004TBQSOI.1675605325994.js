window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Grace Lin is the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of the Newbery Honor book <i>Where the Mountain Meets the Moon</i>. In <i>Ling &amp; Ting</i>, Lin crafts a charming tale about a pair of Chinese-American twins who insist that, despite their physical appearance, they are NOT alike. Ling can’t use chopsticks, no matter how hard she tries. And Ting can’t sit still—a characteristic that makes the twins more different than ever after a small mishap at the barbershop.</p>";
