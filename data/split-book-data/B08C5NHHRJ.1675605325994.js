window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I’m the type of girl who’s given up on fairy tales. So when Beck – the hot new busboy at work - starts flirting with me, I know better than to get my hopes up. Happily ever afters aren’t for the average. I learned that the hard way.</p> <p>But how can I be expected to resist a man who can quote Austen, loves making me laugh, and seems to be everything hot and good in this world?</p> <p>Only there’s so much more to him than that.</p> <p>Billionaire playboy? Check.</p> <p>Troubled soul? Check.</p> <p>The owner of my heart, the man I’ve moved halfway across the country to be with, who’s laying the world at my feet in order to convince me to never leave? Check. Check. Check.</p> <p>But nobody does complicated like the one percent.</p> <p>This is not your everyday rags-to-riches, knight-in-shining armor whisking the poor girl off her feet kind of story. No, this is much messier.</p> <p>“[<i>The</i>] <i>Rich Boy</i> takes you on a literal ride! Funny. Angsty. There's mean rich people and people you root for. It's a definite recommend from me! (Tijan, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author)</p> <p>“[<i>The</i>] <i>Rich Boy </i>was witty, exciting and had the most intense slow burn romance I’ve read in a long time. The complexity of the characters was refreshing and made me wish for more!” (Audrey Carlan, number one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author)</p> <p>“I never knew how much I needed an adult fairy tale in my life until I finished reading <i>The Rich Boy</i>. I was sucked in to the sweet, fun, sexy, slow-burning romance blossoming between Beck and Alice and I didn’t want it to end.” (<i>Bookgasms Book Blog)</i></p> <p>“It is a slow-burn but once it’s there, it’s blazing THEIR CHEMISTRY IS INSANE from the banter, to jokes, to Beck quoting JANE AUSTIN and being the right kind of sarcastic well they both are, to alike-ness, GAH, I loved both the characters!” (<i>The Guide to Romance Novels Reviews</i>)</p> <p>“<i>The Rich Boy</i> has the perfect mix of romance and comedy. Kylie Scotts writing style just flows perfectly and she’s made a brilliantly entertaining rom-com.” (<i>Blogging for the Love of Authors and Their Books</i>)</p> <p>“This was a slow burn that simmered until it became an all out FIRE! The chemistry was INTENSE. Beck was a great guy that knew how to romance his woman. It was impossible not to love him.” (<i>Keri Loves Books</i>)</p>";
