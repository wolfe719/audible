window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>***Academy Reverse Harem***<br> &nbsp;</p> <p><b>Magic exists. I know - it’s in my blood.</b></p> <p>Unfortunately, not all people from magical bloodlines have powers, and at 22, I’m several years past the age they usually appear. So I’ve resigned myself to a boring, magic-less life.</p> <p>Then something strange happens....</p> <p>I get stuck in the middle of a bar fight, and instead of just punching the guy back, I blow a hole in the wall.</p> <p>So...I guess I do have powers. But they’re unlike anything I’ve ever seen before. This shit is definitely <i>not</i> normal.&nbsp;</p> <p>And it seems the magical authorities agree, because they give me a choice: either I go to school to learn to control my crazy new magic, or they’ll take it away. Permanently.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now, if I can just survive the bitchy, mean girls determined to take me down a peg; the mysterious attacks on students; the three hot-as-hell guys who don’t seem turned off by my prickly exterior; and the professor who makes me long for detention, maybe I’ll get out of here in one piece.&nbsp;</p> <p>Wouldn’t bet on it though.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Welcome to the Academy of Unpredictable Magic.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Spark is the first book in the Academy of Unpredictable Magic series, a medium-burn reverse harem story intended for ages 18 plus, featuring a badass chick and the four sexy men who fall in love with her.</i></p>";
