window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The new commander of the 1392nd Allied Protective Expeditionary Services is Hamisha Ann McPherson, and this is her first command of anything larger than a squad. She is a larger-than-life combat veteran and a bonafide war hero. She knows combat. She also knows that combat is one thing, and that command is a warthog of a different and dubious color. Misha wonders if she has the necessary skills to turn this group of slackers, petty criminals, and losers into an effective fighting unit in the short time she has left before being tossed out the back end of a spacecraft to fight in ground-chewing warfare. </p> <p>APES are supposed to be an armored infantry fighting force. However, this unit's last commander retired in the saddle, leaving his unit to unravel and fend for themselves. Their assigned space forces transport captain is less than no help at all. The war with the Binders is heating up and there are secrets swirling around mixed with gossip about the last big battle against the aliens. Some secrets could mean life or death for the ground pounders who wear metal armor in dirt side warfare. </p> <p>Combat is on the horizon, and even the veteran APES doubt they will be ready for what is coming. All Misha can do is crack a few heads, kick some backsides, and see what happens. Her APES might live through the next battle if she is successful. If not.... </p>";
