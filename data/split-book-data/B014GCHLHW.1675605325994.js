window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Grateful Knight isn’t looking for love when she moves into a rent-free house on the edge of a graveyard. At 22, all she wants is to recover financially so she can move back to the city where she belongs. But sparks fly when the gorgeous cemetery caretaker, Rick, introduces himself and mentions his suspicion that her new house might be haunted. Her attraction to him seems supernatural, and, despite her resolve not to get involved, she literally can’t keep her hands off him. </p><p>When things in Grateful’s house start moving on their own, another man enters her life - Logan, a sexy ghost with a dark secret. He says Rick isn’t what he seems, and indulging her passion for him could cost her soul. One thing’s for sure: Magical forces are at work in the tiny town of Red Grove, and they’re converging on Grateful. Life will never be the same once she's forced to choose between the ghost and the graveyard. </p>";
