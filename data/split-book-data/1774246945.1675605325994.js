window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Contains three complete, novel-length books in the Middle Falls Time Travel series.&nbsp;</b></p> <p><i>The Empathetic Life of Rebecca Wright</i>, book 10&nbsp;</p> <p>From the outside, Rebecca Wright had an enviable life, and she enjoyed that envy. She had a beautiful house, handsome husband, and a no-limit credit card. What she didn't have was empathy.</p> <p>But it's never too late in Middle Falls. A lesson that isn't learned in one lifetime can be learned in the next, or the next. Rebecca may need every chance she can get.</p> <p><i>The Successful Life of Jack Rybicki</i>, book 11</p> <p>Jack Rybicki is a high school senior who loves his girl, likes to party, and doesn't have much of a plan for his life. Then fate plucks him from obscurity and Jack, now renamed Jack Noble by his management team, becomes one of the most famous people on the planet. A teenager who likes to indulge himself with limitless resources is not the best recipe for a successful life. But it's never too late in Middle Falls.</p> <p><i>The Many Short Lives of Charles Waters</i>, book 12</p> <p>Charles Waters has 30 days to live. Those days pass in a blur and he dies a quiet, unnoticed death. He opens his eyes back in the doctor's office as he is told, \"I'm sorry to say, but you have 30 days to live.\" Thus begins <i>The Many Short Lives of Charles Waters</i>, who has to live the same 30 days over and over while he finds out what it is to be alive.</p>";
