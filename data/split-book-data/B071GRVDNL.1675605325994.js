Take good and evil, for example. For them, it's an outdated concept that never worked particularly well in the first place. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the sudden disappearance of right and wrong, while welcomed by some, raises certain concerns amongst those still attached to the previous team's management style. </p> <p>In particular, there's one of the old gods who didn't move out with the others. A reclusive chap, he lives somewhere up north, and only a handful even believe in him. </p> <p>But he's watching. And he really does need to know if you've been naughty or nice. </p>";
