Everything changes when receives a mysterious message: <i>You’re a Denton. You belong on Starfall Point. Once you’re here, I’ll tell you everything you need to know.</i></p> <p>When Riley arrives on the island, she learns her aunt has left her a historic mansion brimming with haunted antiques. Turns out, that’s not the only thing she’s inherited. Riley also hails from a long line of witches whose magic is critical to protecting the living.</p> <p>Edison Held, the town’s frustratingly hot librarian, is completely unaware of the ghosts in Riley’s ancestral home and is determined to convince her to open it up to the public.
