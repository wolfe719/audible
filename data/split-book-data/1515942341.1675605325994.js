window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Rose Marshall died when she was 16 years old and on her way to her high school prom. She hasn't been resting easy since then - Bobby Cross, the man who killed her, got away clean after running her off the road, and she's not the kind of girl who can let something like that slide. She's been looking for a way to stop him since before they put her body in the ground.&nbsp;</p> <p>But things have changed in the twilight world where the spirits of the restless dead continue their \"lives\". The crossroads have been destroyed, and Bobby's protections are gone. For the first time, it might be possible for Rose to defeat him.&nbsp;</p> <p>Not alone, though. She'll need every friend she's managed to make and every favor she's managed to add to her account if she wants to stand a chance...and this may be her last chance to be avenged, since what is Bobby Cross without the crossroads?&nbsp;</p> <p>Everything Rose knows is about to change.</p>";
