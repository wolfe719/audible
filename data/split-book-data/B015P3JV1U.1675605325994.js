window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the next book in Molly Harper's Half Moon Hollow paranormal romance series, Libby (a widow turned vampire) struggles with her transition and finds out it sucks to be the only vampire member of the PTA..... </p> <p>Widow Libby Stratton arranged to be turned into a vampire after she was diagnosed with late-stage cancer. It wasn't the best idea she'd ever had, but she was desperate - she wasn't about to leave her seven-year-old son to be raised by her rigid, overbearing in-laws. On top of post-turning transition issues, like being ignored at PTA meetings and other mothers rejecting her son's invitations for sleepovers, Libby must deal with her father-in-law's attempts to declare her an unfit mother, her growing feelings for Wade - a tattooed redneck single dad she met while hiding in a closet at Back to School Night - and the return of her sire, who hasn't stopped thinking about brave, snarky Libby since he turned her. With the help of her new vampire circle, Libby negotiates this unfamiliar quagmire of legal troubles, parental duties, relationships, and, as always in Harper's distinct, comedic novels, \"characters you can't help but fall in love with\" (<i>RT Book Reviews</i>). </p>";
