window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A haunting story of love and war from the best-selling author of</b> <b><i>Americanah&nbsp;</i></b><b>and&nbsp;</b><b><i>We Should All Be Feminists.</i></b>&nbsp;</p> <p>With effortless grace, celebrated author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie illuminates a seminal moment in modern African history: Biafra’s impassioned struggle to establish an independent republic in southeastern Nigeria during the late 1960s. We experience this tumultuous decade alongside five unforgettable characters: Ugwu, a 13-year-old houseboy who works for Odenigbo, a university professor full of revolutionary zeal; Olanna, the professor’s beautiful young mistress who has abandoned her life in Lagos for a dusty town and her lover’s charm; and Richard, a shy young Englishman infatuated with Olanna’s willful twin sister Kainene. <i>Half of a Yellow Sun</i> is a tremendously evocative novel of the promise, hope, and disappointment of the Biafran war.&nbsp;</p>";
