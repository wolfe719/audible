The uneasy balance between these worlds is shattered when Starr witnesses the fatal shooting of her childhood best friend Khalil at the hands of a police officer. Khalil was unarmed.&nbsp;</p> <p>Soon afterward, his death is a national headline. Some are calling him a thug, maybe even a drug dealer and a gangbanger. Protesters are taking to the streets in Khalil’s name. Some cops and the local drug lord try to intimidate Starr and her family. What everyone wants to know is: what <i>really</i> went down that night? And the only person alive who can answer that is Starr.&nbsp;</p> <p>But what Starr does - or does not - say could upend her community. It could also endanger her life.</p> <p><b>And don't miss </b><b><i>On the Come Up</i></b><b>, Angie Thomas's powerful follow-up to </b><b><i>The Hate U Give.</i></b></p>";
