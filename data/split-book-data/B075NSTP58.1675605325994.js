Burners ignited flames, Tiders beckoned waves, and Zélie’s Reaper mother summoned forth souls.</p> <p>But everything changed the night magic disappeared. Under the orders of a ruthless king, maji were killed, leaving Zélie without a mother and her people without hope.</p> <p>Now Zélie has one chance to bring back magic and strike against the monarchy. With the help of a rogue princess, Zélie must outwit and outrun the crown prince, who is hell-bent on eradicating magic for good.</p> <p>Danger lurks in Orïsha, where snow leoponaires prowl and vengeful spirits wait in the waters. Yet the greatest danger may be Zélie herself as she struggles to control her powers - and her growing feelings for an enemy.</p> <p><b>Praise for Children of </b><b><i>Blood and Bone</i></b><b>:</b></p> <p><b>\"[Narrator Bahni Turpin] excels at customizing her voice to capture the unique personalities of each character....
