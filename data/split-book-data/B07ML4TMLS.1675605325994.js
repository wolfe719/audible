window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Everyone's invited...everyone's a suspect....</b></p> <p>For fans of Ruth Ware and Tana French, a shivery, atmospheric, pause-resisting novel of psychological suspense in the tradition of Agatha Christie, in which a group of old college friends are snowed in at a hunting lodge...and murder and mayhem ensue.</p> <p><i>All of them are friends. One of them is a killer.</i></p> <p>During the languid days of the Christmas break, a group of 30-something friends from Oxford meets to welcome in the New Year together, a tradition they began as students 10 years ago. For this vacation, they’ve chosen an idyllic and isolated estate in the Scottish Highlands - the perfect place to get away and unwind by themselves.&nbsp;</p> <p>They arrive on December 30, just before a historic blizzard seals the lodge off from the outside world.</p> <p>Two days later, on New Year’s Day, one of them is dead.</p> <p>The trip began innocently enough: admiring the stunning if foreboding scenery, champagne in front of a crackling fire, and reminiscences about the past. But after a decade, the weight of secret resentments has grown too heavy for the group’s tenuous nostalgia to bear. Amid the boisterous revelry of New Year’s Eve, the cord holding them together snaps.</p> <p>Now, one of them is dead...and another of them did it.</p> <p>Keep your friends close, the old adage goes. But just how close is too close?</p>";
