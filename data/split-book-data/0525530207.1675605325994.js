window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Number one </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best seller </b></p> <p><b>A Reese Witherspoon x Hello Sunshine Book Club pick</b>&nbsp;</p> <p><b><i>USA Today</i></b><b>'s top 100 books to read while stuck at home social distancing </b></p> <p><b>“I’ve been a huge Jojo Moyes fan. Her characters are so compelling.... It’s such a great narrative about personal strength and really captures how books bring communities together.” (Reese Witherspoon) </b></p> <p><b>From the author of&nbsp;</b><b><i>Me Before You</i></b><b>, set in Depression-era America, a breathtaking story of five extraordinary women and their remarkable journey through the mountains of Kentucky and beyond.</b></p> <p>Alice Wright marries handsome American Bennett Van Cleve hoping to escape her stifling life in England. But small-town Kentucky quickly proves equally claustrophobic, especially living alongside her overbearing father-in-law. So, when a call goes out for a team of women to deliver books as part of Eleanor Roosevelt’s new traveling library, Alice signs on enthusiastically.&nbsp;</p> <p>The leader, and soon Alice's greatest ally, is Margery, a smart-talking, self-sufficient woman who's never asked a man's permission for anything. They will be joined by three other singular women who become known as the Packhorse Librarians of Kentucky.</p> <p>What happens to them - and to the men they love - becomes an unforgettable drama of loyalty, justice, humanity, and passion. These heroic women refuse to be cowed by men or by convention. And though they face all kinds of dangers in a landscape that is at times breathtakingly beautiful, at others brutal, they’re committed to their job: Bringing books to people who have never had any, arming them with facts that will change their lives.</p> <p>Based on a true story rooted in America’s past, <i>The Giver of Stars</i> is unparalleled in its scope and epic in its storytelling. Funny, heartbreaking, enthralling, it is destined to become a modern classic - a richly rewarding novel of women’s friendship, of true love, and of what happens when we reach beyond our grasp for the great beyond.</p> <p><b>Soon to be a major motion picture!</b></p>";
