window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In a world where almost everyone has a superpower, Sam Archer finds himself with one of the most useless abilities of all - immortality. Sure, he can’t die, but he sure as hell can’t fight back either. If anything, the incapacity to die has turned out to be a hassle for Sam, with ridiculous requests for obnoxious favors being a primary concern. However, his coworker Lily Dodson is about to make his life a lot more interesting with her unique proposal.</p> <p><b>Warning:</b> This book contains adult content that may not be suitable for all audiences, including suggestive adult scenes, slight harem elements, consensual sexual aggression on a male character by a female (slight BDSM elements), graphic violence, talk about self-harming behavior, and alcohol consumption/drug use.
