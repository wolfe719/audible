window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It was one of the most searing images of the twentieth century: two young boys, two princes, walking&nbsp;behind their mother’s coffin as the world watched in sorrow—and horror. As Princess Diana was laid to&nbsp;rest, billions wondered what Prince William and Prince Harry must be thinking and feeling—and how&nbsp;their lives would play out from that point on.</p> <p>For Harry, this is that story at last.</p> <p>Before losing his mother, twelve-year-old Prince Harry was known as the carefree one, the happy-go-lucky Spare to the more serious Heir. Grief changed everything. He struggled at school, struggled with&nbsp;anger, with loneliness—and, because he blamed the press for his mother’s death, he struggled to accept&nbsp;life in the spotlight.</p> <p>At twenty-one, he joined the British Army. The discipline gave him structure, and two combat tours made&nbsp;him a hero at home. But he soon felt more lost than ever, suffering from post-traumatic stress and prone&nbsp;to crippling panic attacks. Above all, he couldn’t find true love.</p> <p>Then he met Meghan. The world was swept away by the couple’s cinematic romance and rejoiced in their&nbsp;fairy-tale wedding. But from the beginning, Harry and Meghan were preyed upon by the press, subjected&nbsp;to waves of abuse, racism, and lies. Watching his wife suffer, their safety and mental health at risk, Harry&nbsp;saw no other way to prevent the tragedy of history repeating itself but to flee his mother country. Over the&nbsp;centuries, leaving the Royal Family was an act few had dared. The last to try, in fact, had been his mother.&nbsp;. . .</p> <p>For the first time, Prince Harry tells his own story, chronicling his journey with raw, unflinching honesty.&nbsp;A landmark publication, <i>Spare</i> is full of insight, revelation, self-examination, and hard-won wisdom&nbsp;about the eternal power of love over grief.</p>";
