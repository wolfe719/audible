Each step in the meditation practice (<b>R</b>ecognize, <b>A</b>llow, <b>I</b>nvestigate, <b>N</b>urture) is brought to life by memorable stories shared by Tara and her students as they deal with feelings of overwhelm, loss, and self-aversion, with painful relationships, and past trauma - and as they discover step-by-step the sources of love, forgiveness, compassion, and deep wisdom alive within all of us.</p>";
