window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Move over, Junie B. Jones and Ivy and Bean! Here comes a lovably energetic little sister with a BIG personality - and an imagination to match! </p> <p>As the youngest in her family, Dory really wants attention; and more than anything, she wants her brother and sister to play with her. But she's too much of a baby for them, so she's left to her own devices - including her wild imagination and untiring energy. Her siblings may roll their eyes at her childish games, but Dory has lots of things to do: outsmarting the monsters all over the house, escaping from prison (aka time-out), and exacting revenge on her sister's favorite doll. And when they really need her, daring Dory will prove her bravery, and finally get exactly what she has been looking for. </p>";
