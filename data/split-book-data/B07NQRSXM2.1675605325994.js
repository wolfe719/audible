window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ex-Goddess. Queen of the Underworld. About to Raise Hell.</p> <p>My name is Persephone, yes, that one. Two thousand years ago, the Gods fell, but my husband, Hades, saved me by stripping me of my God powers. I fled while my family died and I have carried the guilt ever since. Two weeks ago, my old frenemy, Eris showed up in the small town of Bedford where I live. She was searching for a way to raise a God. Her first choice - Ares.</p> <p>We fought and I defeated her, but not before she smashed the bottle containing the elixir needed to raise the dead. I managed to salvage some of it, but will it be enough?</p> <p>Now I am searching for the power source hidden in the town, a power that could reunite me with my husband or my mother, Demeter. I don’t want to choose, but that will come later. I need to find what I am looking for first.</p> <p>One thing is for sure, small town life is no longer boring. Time to raise a little hell.</p>";
