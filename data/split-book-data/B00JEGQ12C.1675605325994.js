window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One afternoon - after another failed attempt to get motivated to exercise - I (accidentally) started my first mini habit. I initially committed to do one push-up, and it turned into a full workout. I was shocked. This \"stupid idea\" wasn't supposed to work. I was shocked again when my success with this strategy continued for months (and to this day). I had to consider that maybe I wasn't the problem in those 10 years of mediocre results. Maybe it was my prior strategies that were ineffective, despite being oft-repeated as \"the way to change\" in countless books and blogs. </p> <p>I was right.</p> <p>Is there a scientific explanation for this? </p> <p>As I sought understanding, I found a plethora of scientific studies that had answers, with nobody to interpret them correctly. Based on the science - which you'll find peppered throughout Mini Habits - we've been doing it all wrong. </p> <p>You can succeed without the guilt, intimidation, and repeated failure associated with such strategies as \"getting motivated,\" New Year's Resolutions, or even \"just doing it.\" In fact, you need to stop using those strategies if they aren't giving you great results. They don't work because they all require you to fight against your subconscious brain (a fight not easily won). It's only when you start playing by your brain's rules and taking your human limitations seriously--as mini habits show you how to do - that you can achieve lasting change.</p>";
