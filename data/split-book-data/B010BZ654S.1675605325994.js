window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Omega Force is back! </p> <p>After the daring rescue of a political dissident, Omega Force is contracted to investigate a rash of violent attacks on civilian shipping lanes within a group of star systems known as the Concordian Cluster. It seems a simple enough job with a huge payday at the end, and it's exactly what the ragtag group of mercenaries needs in order to keep their ship flying and to stay one step ahead of those hunting them. </p> <p>However, the further they delve into the seedy underworld of the Cluster, the more they realize they may be in over their heads. With innocent lives hanging in the balance, Captain Burke and his crew begin a desperate race to uncover who is responsible for these attacks, and why, before their ultimate goal can be realized. </p> <p><i>Soldiers of Fortune</i> is the follow up to the popular novel <i>Omega Rising</i> and the second book in the Omega Force series. It continues the adventures of Jason Burke, a lone human in space who has linked up with five other aliens to try their luck as hired guns. Their mandate: to help those who don't have the means to help themselves and never accept a job that would compromise the honor code they live by. </p>";
