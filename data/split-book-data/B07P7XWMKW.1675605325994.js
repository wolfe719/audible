window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>With magical animals, science, mystery, and adventure - the brand new series, Zoey and Sassafras, has something for everyone!</b></p> <p>In the first book of this series, Zoey discovers a glowing photo and learns an amazing secret. Injured magical animals come to their backyard barn for help! When a sick baby dragon appears, it’s up to Zoey and Sassafras to figure out what’s wrong. Will they be able to help little Marshmallow before it’s too late?&nbsp;</p> <p>Each story in the <i>Zoey and Sassafras</i> series features a new magical animal with a problem that must be solved using science. There isn't a set formula for each book. Sometimes, Zoey needs to run experiments, while other times she needs to investigate a mystery, and yet other times she needs to do research.&nbsp;</p> <p>Zoey models how to keep a science journal through her entries in each story. Each story is complete with a glossary of the kid-friendly definitions for scientific terms used. The series highlights child-led inquiry science and the topics covered align with both Common Core and Next Generation Science Standards.</p>";
