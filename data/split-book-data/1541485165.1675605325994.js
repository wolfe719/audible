window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For Rose Marshall, death has long since become the only life she really knows. She's been sweet 16 for more than 60 years, hitchhiking her way along the highways and byways of America, sometimes seen as an avenging angel, sometimes seen as a killer in her own right, but always Rose, the phantom prom date, the girl in the green silk gown.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The man who killed her is still out there thanks to a crossroads bargain that won't let him die, and he's looking for the one who got away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>When Bobby Cross comes back into the picture, there's going to be hell to pay - possibly literally. Rose has worked for decades to make a place for herself in the twilight. Can she defend it when Bobby Cross comes to take her down? Can she find a way to navigate the worlds of the living and the dead and make it home before her hitchhiker's luck runs out?&nbsp;</p> <p>There's only one way to know for sure.</p>";
