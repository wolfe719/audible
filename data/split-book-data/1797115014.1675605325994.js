window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From TV personality and radio host Bill Flanagan comes a \"funny and sharp” (Rosanne Cash, Grammy Award-winning singer/songwriter and best-selling author) time-traveling adventure novel about how the past never gives up its hold on the present and how even 65-year-olds are still kids at heart. </b></p> <p>If you had the chance to live your life over again, knowing everything that you know now, would you take it? Would you still take it if it meant losing everything you had today? Would a second chance to correct every mistake and missed opportunity be worth giving up the world you know and the life you have built? In <i>Fifty in Reverse</i>, 15-year-old Peter Wyatt does just that.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the spring of 1970, Harvard psychologist Terry Canyon is introduced to Peter, a quiet kid from a wealthy family who has been suspended from ninth grade for stripping off his clothes in algebra class. When Terry asks Peter why he did it, the boy explains that he was trying to “shock myself awake”. It turns out that Peter believes he is a 65-year-old man who went to sleep in his home in New York in the year 2020 and woke up in his childhood bedroom 50 years earlier.&nbsp;</p> <p>Hilariously depicting Peter’s attempts to fit in as a 15-year-old in 1970 and to cope with the tedium, foolishness, and sexual temptations of high school as he tries to retain the sense of himself as a 65-year-old man, <i>Fifty in Reverse</i> is a thought-provoking and enlightening novel about second chances and appreciating where you are in life.</p>";
