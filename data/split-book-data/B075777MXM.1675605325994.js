window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Horror meets humorous urban fantasy in the sixth book in the White Trash Zombie series. </p> <p>Winner of the 2012 Best Urban Fantasy Protagonist by the RT Awards. </p> <p>Angel Crawford has finally pulled herself together (literally!) after her disastrous dismemberment on Mardi Gras. She's putting the pieces of her life back in order and is ready to tackle whatever the future holds. </p> <p>Too bad the future is a nasty bitch. There's a new kind of zombie in town: mindless shamblers, infectious and ravenous. </p> <p>With the threat of a full-blown shambler pandemic looming, and a loved one stricken, Angel and the \"real\" zombies scramble to find a cure. Yet when Angel uncovers the true reason the plague is spreading so quickly, she adds \"no-holds-barred revenge\" to her to-do list. Angel is busting her ass dealing with shambling hordes, zombie gators, government jerks, and way too many mosquitos, but this white trash chick ain't giving up. </p> <p>Good thing, since the fate of the world is resting on her undead shoulders. </p>";
