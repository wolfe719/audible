window.bookSummaryJSON = "Leroy Ninker is a small man with a big dream: he wants to be a cowboy, but for now, he's just a thief. In fact, Leroy is robbing the Watsons' kitchen right this minute! As he drags the toaster across the counter ( <i>screeeeeech</i>) and drops it into his bag ( <i>clannngggg</i>), little does he know that a certain large pig who loves toast with a great deal of butter is stirring from sleep. <p> Even less could he guess that a comedy of errors (not to mention the buttery sweets in his pocket) will soon lead this little man on the wild and raucous rodeo ride he's always dreamed of! Nosy neighbors, astonished firemen, a puzzled policeman, and the return of the ever-doting Watsons make for a new tongue-in-snout adventure about Kate DiCamillo's delightfully single-minded pig.</p>";
