window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The “enchanting” (</b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><b>) Jane Jameson series is back with a new paranormal romantic comedy about a werewolf yearning to find her own place in the world and the group of admittedly unique vampires who help her find love.</b></p> <p>Tylene McClaine, black sheep of the McClaine Half Moon Hollow werewolf pack, has spent a lifetime blocking out the criticisms of her boisterous pack. They say she’s too bookish, too sarcastic, and worst of all, too picky when it comes to finding a nice werewolf boy and settling down.</p> <p>But when she meets vampire and Half Moon Hollow music teacher Alex Bonfils, Tylene starts to wonder if she could create the life she’s always wanted. She takes every precaution to meet her sexy vamp in secret, but when a vandal around town starts targeting vampire businesses, she fears her family might have found her out. When the damage in town escalates, Tylene and Alex join forces with Jane Jameson, Dick Cheney, and the whole vampire gang to find the culprit and save Half Moon Hollow before it’s too late!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
