One thing is certain - they won't be able to save everyone. Not with their humanity still intact.&nbsp;</p> <p>The explosive Trackers series is a harrowing story of survival and a realistic depiction of what an EMP attack and the aftermath might look like from former Homeland Security disaster mitigation officer and <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Nicholas Sansbury Smith.
