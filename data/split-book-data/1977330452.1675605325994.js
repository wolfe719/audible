window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Three months ago, I landed a job as a bartender. But not at a bar-at a guild. Yeah, the magic kind.&nbsp;</p> <p>I'm not a badass mage like my three smokin' hot best friends. I'm not a sorcerer or an alchemist, or even a wussy witch. I'm just a human, slinging drinks like a pro and keeping my non-magical nose out of mythic business. Seriously, I know my limits.&nbsp;</p> <p>So why am I currently standing in a black-magic ritual circle across from a fae lord?&nbsp;</p> <p>Somewhere behind me, my three mage friends are battling for their lives. Somewhere near my feet is the rogue witch I just knocked out with a stolen spell. And I have about five seconds to convince this very angry sea god not to shmoosh me like a bug.&nbsp;</p> <p>I'm pretty sure this wasn't part of the job description.&nbsp;</p> <p>Make sure to check out the companion series, The Guild Codex: Demonized, available now, and The Guild Codex: Warped, coauthored by Rob Jacobsen.</p>";
